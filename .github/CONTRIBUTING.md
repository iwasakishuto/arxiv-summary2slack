# Contributing to paper-summary2slack

There are many ways to contribute to [paper-summary2slack](https://github.com/iwasakishuto/paper-summary2slack), with the most common ones being contribution of code or documentation to the project. I haven't made the documentation yet, so I would really appreciate it if you could. I'm planning to make a document under the `docs/` directory using [`pelican`](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/), [`Mkdocs`](https://www.mkdocs.org/), [`sphinx`](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/), etc.

Another way to contribute is to report issues you're facing, and give a "thumbs up üëç" on issues that others reported and that are relevant to you. It also helps us if you spread the word: reference the project from your blog and articles, link to it from your website, or simply star it in GitHub to say "I use it".
